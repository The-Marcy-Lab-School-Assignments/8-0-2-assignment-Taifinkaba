# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Using API keys from the frontend is a significant security risk. Everything on the frontend is public, so anyone can see the key and use it for their own benefit. API keys, in a sense, act as a developerâ€™s ID. If someone else gains access to their personal ID, they can impersonate that person and misuse it, such as by violating terms of service or overusing the API. If actions violate the terms and services, the API will assume the key owner is responsible, which could lead to issues for the key owner. Many API keys are also associated with payment. Making an API request from the server avoids making the API key public, which helps keep your identity safe.
